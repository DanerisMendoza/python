# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default),
for x in range(6):
  print(x)

# adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):
for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)

# increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3)
for x in range(2, 30, 3):
    print(x)
